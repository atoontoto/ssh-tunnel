# SSH tunneling script

A simple script I made to automate **port forwarding via SSH** — because who likes to deal with that tedious syntax? 

---

##  Usage guide
```bash
chmod +x ssh-tunnel.sh
./ssh-tunnel.sh
```

### Local or remote?

Local: When you wanna get a remote meachine's service onto your own machine. (e.g pull a remote service towards yourself


Remote: When you wanna get your own service on a remote machine. (e.g push your own local service outwards, to the remote machine)
